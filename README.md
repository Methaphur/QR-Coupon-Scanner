# QR-Coupon-Scanner

A lightweight **QR-based event management system** that uses **Google Sheets + Google Apps Script** as the backend and a simple static webpage as the frontend for scanning and verifying coupons.

You can easily host the frontend as a static page on **GitHub Pages** - just upload the contents of the `frontend` folder to your repository and enable GitHub Pages. No server setup is needed. The static HTML and JavaScript send requests directly to your Google Apps Script Web App endpoint, allowing real-time coupon validation and usage tracking right from the browser.
